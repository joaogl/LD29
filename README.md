**Main Idea**
- Top down view. (2D)
- You are inside a cave. Your goal is get back to the surface.
- The world has fallen apart and it might be the end of humanity.
- During your journey u might find more beings that might help you... or not... 
- You only get the light from the surface or from beneath which is lava?
- You start out bloody and hurt.
- You collapse and someone finds you and heals you.
- The bandages will came off after a while and you get a new change of clothes.
- There will be different classes for each person you meet, medic, warrior, scout.
- The first guy you meet is a medic.
